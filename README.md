📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Sales Dataset
🌟 Project Overview
This project is designed as a learning guide for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python.

The goal is to walk through the EDA process step by step, so learners can:
- Clean and prepare real-world data
- Explore data distributions
- Visualize patterns and trends
- Draw meaningful insights that can be used for decision-making or modeling
🛠️ Tech Stack / Tools
We use Python and common data analysis libraries:

- ![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/pandas-%23150458.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=pandas&logoColor=white)
-  → data cleaning & manipulation
  - ![NumPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/numpy-%23013243.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=numpy&logoColor=white)
  -  → numerical computations
matplotlib & seaborn → static visualizations
plotly (optional) → interactive visualizations
jupyter notebook → step-by-step documentation & coding
🧾 Learning Roadmap (Steps in EDA)
Each step in the notebook explains what we are doing and why, so learners can follow along.

### 1. Data Cleaning 🧹
- Handle missing values (drop / impute)
- Remove duplicates
- Convert data types (e.g., Date → datetime)

### 2. Descriptive Statistics 📈
Use df.describe() for summary statistics
Check distributions of numerical features
Count unique values in categorical columns

### 3. Data Visualization 🎨
Univariate Analysis: histograms, bar plots
Bivariate Analysis: scatter plots, box plots
Time Series Analysis: line plots for sales over time

### 4. Correlation & Relationships 🔍
Create a correlation matrix
Plot a heatmap to identify relationships between variables

### 5. Insights & Business Questions 💡
Which regions perform the best in terms of sales?
How do sales change over time?
Are there seasonal patterns or anomalies?

📊 Visualizations
- Line chart: Sales trend over time
- Bar chart: Top-performing regions
- Heatmap: Correlation between numerical features

📌 Key Takeaways for Learners
EDA is the foundation of data science → always start by understanding your data.
Even without advanced features (e.g., no profit column), you can still discover patterns and trends.
Data visualization is a powerful tool for storytelling and communicating findings.
