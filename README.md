[Exploratory Data Analytics (EDA) - Sales Dataset](https://github.com/teefortech/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/main/EDA%20-%20Sales_Data.ipynb)



## Project Overview
This project is designed as a learning guide for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python.

The goal is to walk through the EDA process step by step, so learners can:
- Clean and prepare real-world data
- Explore data distributions
- Visualize patterns and trends
- Draw meaningful insights that can be used for decision-making or modeling

### Tech Stack / Tools
We use Python and common data analysis libraries:

- ![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/pandas-%23150458.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=pandas&logoColor=white) → data cleaning & manipulation
- ![NumPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/numpy-%23013243.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=numpy&logoColor=white) → numerical computations
- matplotlib & seaborn → static visualizations
- plotly (optional) → interactive visualizations
- jupyter notebook → step-by-step documentation & coding

### Learning Roadmap (Steps in EDA)
Each step in the notebook explains what we are doing and why, so learners can follow along.

### 1. Data Cleaning 
- Handle missing values (drop / impute)
- Remove duplicates
- Convert data types (e.g., Date → datetime)

### 2. Descriptive Statistics 
We use df.describe() for summary statistics
Check distributions of numerical features
Count unique values in categorical columns

### 3. Data Visualization 
+ Univariate Analysis: histograms, bar plots
+ Bivariate Analysis: scatter plots, box plots
+ Time Series Analysis: line plots for sales over time
+ Line chart: Sales trend over time
- Bar chart: Top-performing regions
- Heatmap: Correlation between numerical features

### 4. Correlation & Relationships 
Create a correlation matrix
Plot a heatmap to identify relationships between variables

### 5. Insights & Business Questions 
Which regions perform the best in terms of sales?
How do sales change over time?
Are there seasonal patterns or anomalies?

### Key Takeaways for Learners
EDA is the foundation of data science → always start by understanding your data.
Even without advanced features (e.g., no profit column), you can still discover patterns and trends.
Data visualization is a powerful tool for storytelling and communicating findings.
